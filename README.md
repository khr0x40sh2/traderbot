# traderbot
Python trading bot using the Webull unofficial API

This is a very alpha release and does not have all of the required files at this time as I am working through cleaning up the code.
Out of the box, this python file currently will not work as it requires a mysql database and a few config files, these are planned to be included soon.

Eventually a requirements.txt for the pip packages, and a source.sql for the mysql database will be included to aid in setting this up.
